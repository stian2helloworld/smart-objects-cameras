# Help Me Code (Student Version)

I'm a student working on the Smart Objects camera project. I want to build a new feature or fix something.

Please help me by:

1. **First, understand what already exists**
   - Look at similar scripts in this repo
   - Check if there are examples in oak-examples
   - Understand how the existing code works

2. **Then, explain your plan to me**
   - What approach will you take?
   - Why is this a good choice?
   - What existing code are you building on?

3. **Build the feature**
   - Follow the patterns used in other scripts
   - Explain what you're doing as you go
   - Make sure it works with the OAK-D camera and depthai 3.x

4. **Show me how to use it**
   - Give me clear examples
   - Explain any new command-line flags
   - Tell me how to test it

**My request:** [Describe what you want to build or fix here]
